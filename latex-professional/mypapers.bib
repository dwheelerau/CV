  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the gene
              expression associated with the persistence of a Listeria
              monocytogenes stationary phase population when facing lethal
              nisin treatment METHODS: RNA Seq analysis was used for gene
              expression profiling of the persister cells in rich medium
              (persister TN) compared with untreated cells (non-persister).The
              results were confirmed using RT PCR. RESULTS: Functional genes
              associated with the persister populations were identified in
              multiple systems, such as heat shock related stress response,
              cell wall synthesis, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system,
              phosphotransferase system (PTS system), and SOS/DNA repair.
              CONCLUSIONS: This study pointed to genetic regulation of
              persister cells exposed to lethal nisin and provides some insight
              into possible mechanisms of impeding bacterial persistence.",

  abstract    = "Over the last decades, several studies have reported emissions
                 of nitrous oxide (N2 O) from microalgal cultures and aquatic
                 ecosystems characterized by a high level of algal activity
                 (e.g. eutrophic lakes). As N2 O is a potent greenhouse gas and
                 an ozone-depleting pollutant, these findings suggest that
                 large-scale cultivation of microalgae (and possibly, natural
                 eutrophic ecosystems) could have a significant environmental
                 impact. Using the model unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas
                 reinhardtii, this study was conducted to investigate the
                 molecular basis of microalgal N2 O synthesis. We report that
                 C. reinhardtii supplied with nitrite (NO2(-) ) under aerobic
                 conditions can reduce NO2(-) into nitric oxide (NO) using
                 either a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) or a dual
                 enzymatic system of nitrate reductase (NR) and
                 amidoxime-reducing component, and that NO is subsequently
                 reduced into N2 O by the enzyme NO reductase (NOR). Based on
                 experimental evidence and published literature, we hypothesize
                 that when nitrate (NO3(-) ) is the main Nitrogen source and
                 the intracellular concentration of NO2(-) is low (i.e. under
                 physiological conditions), microalgal N2 O synthesis involves
                 the reduction of NO3(-) to NO2(-) by NR followed by the
                 reduction of NO2(-) to NO by the dual system involving NR.
                 This microalgal N2 O pathway has broad implications for
                 environmental science and algal biology because the pathway of
                 NO3(-) assimilation is conserved among microalgae, and because
                 its regulation may involve NO.",
